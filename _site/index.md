You've come across **Forgotten Notes**—a [[Digital Garden|digital garden]] of knowledge. Come in and make yourself comfortable.

This website serves as a platform for my learning and creative endeavours. A space for thinking through, building upon, and coming back to. It is part of my effort to organize my own theories, concepts, and ideas in a more public setting.

You will find within a wide range of topics, expanding and exploring ideas across multiple disciplines. In a way, you could say the [[Scope of Work|scope of work]] for the website is not only allowed to, but expected to grow. Forgotten Notes embraces the inherent [[Rhizomatic Learning|rhizomatic learning]] and web-like nature of our thinking. It is a living document designed for an audience of one, myself.

Like me, all notes contained within should be considered work-in-progress. Expect changes at all content levels. That said, I try not to let perfectionism get in the way. That means what you read here is not authoritative or complete, and is not representative of my best work. Please keep that in mind as you navigate around the garden. I'm glad you are here. Enjoy your visit!

Thanks for visiting. Please tell your dog (or cat) I said "Hi"!
